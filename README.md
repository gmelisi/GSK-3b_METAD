In this repository, sample input files are provided to carry out for the complex between GSK-3β and compound **4** (ARN25494):
- PCV-metadynamics simulations to assess the conformational preference of D3R/GSK-3β dual target-directed ligands.
- Funnel-metadynamics simulations to measure the free-energy cost for ligand detachment.
The ligands have been recently published in the "*European Journal of Medicinal Chemistry*" as [Di Martino *et al.*, 2025](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0223523425006646).


## Input files

The zip file (deposited as egg in the Plumed-NEST, includes:
- Gromacs topology, equlibrated structure, index and MD parameters files.
- Plumed input specifics for the simulation.
- PDB templates read by Plumed files to recompact the system for PBC treatment, define PCVs, apply restraints, including the funnel used during unbinding.
